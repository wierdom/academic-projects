# parallel-fortran
Fortran 90 code written with Dr. Pinaki Sengupta to implement the Stochastic Series Expansion method for quantum Monte Carlo evaluation of the spin S=1 Heisenberg model. This code utilized MPI directives to perform parallel tempering on high performance computer clusters (multiple points in parameter space are evaluated in parallel with swapping of state configurations to reduce autocorrelation of the Markov chain data).

# serial-cpp
C++11 code written with Dr. Kevin Beach to implement the evaluation of correlation functions in so-called AKLT states (special quantum states with nontrivial topological properties). The quantum wavefunction is represented with the valence bond formalism, which we have extended to deal with arbitrary values of the spin quantum number.

# python-script
Python script written with Dr. Ying-Jer Kao to perform time evolution using iTEBD (infinite time-evolving block decimation). This script utilizes a python library (pyuni10--see uni10.org for details) that Dr. Kao wrote to support calculations using the matrix product state and tensor network formalism.
